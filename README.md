# PhD thesis template for the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Oslo


This latex file is modified based on the template file from [Department of Informatics, UiO](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/tjenester/it/hjelp/latex/uiophd.html)

Change note:

* on cover page, remove the detail date, only keep date in the format as month-year
* add UiO logo to the cover page
* provide template for long tables (multiple page) and wide tables.
* use smaller font in bibliography

Things need to change when using this latex template:
* title, `\title{YOUR UiO PhD THESIS TITLE}`
* name, `\author{FIRSTNAME LASTNAME }`
* path to figure folder, `\graphicspath{{/PATH_TO_YOUR_FIGURE_FOLDER/}}`
